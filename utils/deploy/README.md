# Deploy Functions

A selection of functions that handle deploying contracts.

## Note

Only contracts that should be deployed to staging / production will have a
deployment function in this directory. Functions related to the deployment of
dummy / testing contracts should be colocated in their appropriate directories
under `tests/*`.
